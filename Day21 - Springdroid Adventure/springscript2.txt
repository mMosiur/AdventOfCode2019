# In the beginning J is 0 and T is 0
# If J is true at the end of the script, the droid will jump

# Next instructions set J to ~(B&C) or ~B|~C
# so J register will have information whether B or C is a hole
OR B J
AND C J
NOT J J

# Make J false if D (the landing spot if droid jumps now) is false (hole)
AND D J

# Make J false if H is false (hole)
# H is the next-next landing spot, so a spot where droid would land if instructions
# had jumped now and jumped again immediately after landing.
