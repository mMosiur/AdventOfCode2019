# In the beginning J is 0 and T is 0
# If J is true at the end of the script, the droid will jump

# Next instructions set J to ~(B&C) or ~B|~C
# so J register will have information whether B or C is a hole
OR B J
AND C J
NOT J J

# Make J false if D (the landing spot if droid jumps now) is false (hole)
AND D J

# Set T to ~A (true if A is a hole)
NOT A T

# So if T is true (A is a hole) override calculations
# and make droid jump (next step would make him fall regardless)
OR T J

# Execute script
WALK
